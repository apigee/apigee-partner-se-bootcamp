API Services: Lesson 1 - Backend-as-a-Service
=================================================

Overview
---------
Edge API Services includes a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) solution that provides developers with access to a flexible data store and enables you to quickly integrate valuable features into your app, including social graphs, user management, data storage, push notifications, performance monitoring, and more.
Using API BaaS, you can set up your own cloud-based data platform in minutes instead of months – no server-side coding or back-end development needed. This allows your team to focus on developing the rich features and user experience that truly differentiate your app, rather than on the time-consuming details of implementing core back-end services and infrastructure.
API Baas provides the following features:

	Data storage & management
	--------------------------
		Application data 
		----------------
		At the core of the BaaS is a flexible platform that can store any type of application data, from simple records like a catalog of books to complex associations like user relationships. No matter what type of data drives your app, you can store it as collections of data entities and immediately perform complex queries or full-text searches on any field. You can also create custom entities with custom properties, giving you the ability to store data and context in a way that makes sense for your app.
		To learn more about entities and collections, see [API BaaS Data model](http://apigee.com/docs/app-services/content/app-services-data-model-1).
